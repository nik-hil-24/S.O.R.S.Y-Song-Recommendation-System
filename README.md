**Project Description:**

This project entails the use of the Spotify-Million-Playlist-Dataset to develop a bespoke music recommendation system. By leveraging Spotify's spotipy API, I extracted a wide array of features for each track or song included in the dataset, which covers aspects such as genre, key, tempo, and lyrical sentiment. Post extraction, the data undergoes a rigorous cleaning and preprocessing stage to guarantee optimal quality for the subsequent recommendation system. Moreover, I integrated data visualization techniques to facilitate a deeper understanding of the different track attributes, their interrelations, and distributions.

Building upon this foundation, the project also incorporates sentiment analysis on selected features, particularly track name, to discern their potential impact on song popularity and listener preferences. The core of the recommendation system employs collaborative filtering, a method which aligns users with similar musical tastes and preferences, recommending songs based on these shared interests. The project concludes with the development of a user-friendly web application via the Flask framework, designed to provide an intuitive platform for users to engage with the recommendation system and explore the attributes of their suggested songs. Through merging data science and music, this project delivers an innovative, personalized music recommendation system that enhances the user's music discovery journey.
